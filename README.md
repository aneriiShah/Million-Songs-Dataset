# Million-Songs-Dataset
In this project, we will build a music recommendation system using Million Songs Dataset form Kaggle website. This dataset contains Kaggle_visible _evaluation_triplets and songs_data files. The first file contains user_id, song_id and listen_count and the second file contain song_id, title, release_by and artist_name. We used Python library, Pandas, to integrate our dataset for creating a data processing pipeline. The merged dataset has 2 M rows.
In the first part, we chose songs that has been played more frequently to obtain the popular songs. After that, we split our data into training and testing data. In the next step, we used recommender class to train our model which accepts user_id as an input and recommend a list of song based on the popularity of each song. 
In the second part, we create a Machine Learning personalized song recommender system by using the item similarity based collaborative filtering model. In item-item filtering approach, the function creates a co-current matrix based on a song a user likes. This matrix contains data for each song based on what number of times a user, who have listened to that song, will also listen to other songs. Then, we can predict what other similar song a user will like based on what you like in the past and what other similar users have liked.
